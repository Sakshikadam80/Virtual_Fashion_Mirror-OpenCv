# Virtual_Fashion_Mirror-OpenCv
    It is a virtual dressing room where you can see how shirts appear on you. This project has been made to reduce the human effort of trying many clothes in stores and to provide a virtual platform for experimenting with different cloth styles on an online platform as well.
